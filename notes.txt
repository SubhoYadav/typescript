Learning typescript

Install typescript globally: 
npm i typescript -g

Command to compile the typescript into javascript
typescript is just a dev tool that gives u static checking

tsc main.ts
tsc main.ts -w : watches for changes in the file specified and recompiles, when anything changes in the ts file the compiler is watching .

Generate the config file for typescript
tsc --init

Important configs for typescript:

"outDir": "./build/js",                                   
/* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */

"rootDir": "./src",                                  
/* Specify the root folder within your source files. */


"include": [
    "src"
] 
This thing will tell the tsc not to compile ts files outside the src directory

"noEmitOnError": true,                            
/* Disable emitting files if any type checking errors are reported. */

The following command uses the config noEmitOnError in while launching the tsc command
tsc --noEmitOnError -w

static or dynamically typed languages are not synonimous to strongly or loosely typed languages, a strongly typed language may be statically typed or dynamically typed

Typescript is a statically typed programming language, meaning the types are checked at compile time
