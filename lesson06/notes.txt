strongly typed languages and loosly typed languages are not the same as
statically tped and dynamically typed languages, so, a strongly typed language can be 
typed statically or dynamically.

static typed languages are those where the types are checked at compile time(e.g. Typescript) whereas dynamic type languages are
those where the types are checked at runtime(e.g. Javascript).

Benifits of typescript:
Self documenting code
helps to catch buhs in dev
great for large collaborating teams
